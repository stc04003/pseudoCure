Description: A collection of easy-to-use tools for regression analysis of survival data with a cure fraction. The modeling framework is based on the Cox proportional hazards mixture cure model and the bounded cumulative hazard (promotion time cure) model. The pseudo-observations approach is utilized to assess covariate effects and embedded in the variable selection procedure.
